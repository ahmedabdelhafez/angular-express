/*
If you want a consistent look across different screen sizes you will find this aspect ratio mixin useful.
It maintains the aspect ratio at any screen size. 
To use this mixin, you need two HTML elements: an outer and an inner one.
The mixin calculates the aspect ratio of the two elements and maintains that at any resolution.
